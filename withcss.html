My name is Angelo M. Manimtim, and I was born on 5Th day of April, year 2001. I am the second son of Mr. Fernando A. Manimtim and Mrs. Gemma M. Manimtim. I was born at Brgy. Old Balara Quezon City. I’m currently living at Victoria Sual, Pangasinan. 
<p align="justify">
My family started living here since I was 2 years old because of financial problem. Both of my parents are farmer. I have one sister, her name is Hazel M. Manimtim and one brother, his name is Fernando M. Manimtim. Blue is my favorite color and I love planting. Playing online games is one of my hobbies. I graduated in elementary at Raymunda Verzosa Elementary school and I finished my studies in High school at Sual National High School. I’m currently studying at Pangasinan State University Lingayen Campus.
<p align="justify">
I’m one of the persons who believes that everything is a learning experience. I will do all of what it takes to become a successful person someday.
